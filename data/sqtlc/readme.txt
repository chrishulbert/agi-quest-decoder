This game was written, designed and programmed all out of affection
for Sierra's Space Quest Series.

Space Quest, Roger Wilco and many of the other aspects of the game
are copyrighted to Sierra.

The file Sqtlc.com will run the game as I have supplied Sierra's Adventure
Game Interpreter with the game so it will be easy to run.

If you have received it as a zip file, simply unzip the files in a folder and
then run Sqtlc.com.

There are people I have to recognise here and mainly they are :

Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe, creators of Space Quest and hence genesis of this game.

Sierra On-Line and all the people who worked there for helping put out this great series of 
games.

Peter Kelly, creator of AGI Studio which allowed me to build this game. Thanks to this man's
work on a great piece of software I was able to fulfill a dream of creating my own AGI game.

My brother JR, who helped me with certain development aspects to the game and spurred 
me on when I needed it. Having another SQ fan in my corner was invaluable.

All the other people who have tried AGI games over the years. I've downloaded and played
most if not all of them and I gleamed ideas from many.

Roger Wilco, truly an inspiring indivual, who almost single handedly motivated me to spend so
much time and effort on this game. It was my desire to see him tackle the stars again that kept 
me going when things looked bleak.
